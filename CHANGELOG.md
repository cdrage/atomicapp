# Atomic App Base Container Image

Welcome to Atomic App, this is the reference implementation of the [Container
Application Specification](http://www.projectatomic.io/nulecule/spec/0.0.2/index.html) (aka the Nulecule Specification)

## Atomic App 0.1.11 (2015-Sept-23)

This is a hotfix to 0.1.10 and removed a bug we had in [Missing config file error (~/.kube/config) in 0.1.10](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/issues/280).

Author: Václav Pavlín <vaclav.pavlin@gmail.com>
 * Do not use sudo in Docker provider, Fixes #281

 * Generate provider config for kubernetes if it does not exist

    There is new unimplemented method in Plugin - generateConfigFile.
    This method is invoked in case a provider calls checkConfigFile
    and the file does not exist. If provider does not implement
    this method, error about missing configuration file will
    be printed out. Config file will be generated and used if the method
    is implemented.  
    Currently, it is implemented only by Kubernetes provider.
    Fixes #280

Author: Charlie Drage <charlie@charliedrage.com>

 * fix openshift import warning

## Atomic App 0.1.10 (2015-Sept-21)

With this releasewe have fixed many bugs and implemented many enhancements, please see the [Atomic App Issue tracker](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/issues/) for the past.

A summary of the major new features is given below.

Author: Charlie Drage <charlie@charliedrage.com>

 * More unit testing / restructure
 * undeploy added to docker provider
 * dont ask for missing artifacts if stopping
 * debian dockerfile support

Author: Ratnadeep Debnath <rtnpro@gmail.com>

 * Convert global params in Nulecule file to `Dict` rather than `List`, fixed #276

Author: Václav Pavlín <vaclav.pavlin@gmail.com>

 * Add `providerconfig` option to fix #266
 * Add Dockerfile for running tests, add How-to-test to CONTRIBUTION.md

Author: Navid Shaikh <nshaikh@redhat.com>
 * Add the right nodePort from allowed port range, reference <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/services.md#type-nodeport>
 * Add tests for fix of issue #212
 * Fixes processing multiple k8s artifacts resources
      - Nulecule multiple resource artifacts defined per kind of resource can now be
      processed without overriding earlier artifacts
      - Modifies the methods names as per <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables>
      - Alters order of imports as per <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>
      - Adds docstring to methods
 * Adds support for resizing replicas if using kube v1 APIs   
      This patch adds provision for lookup of resource identity based on the API
      version under processing. Presently support for v1, v1beta3 and v1beta1 APIs
      are included.

Author: Aaron Weitekamp <aweiteka@redhat.com>

 * Fix typo in docs/cli.md
 * Add provider documentation
 * Add --provider option
    The --provider option is constrained to supported providers.
    Providers can be specified in answers.conf. If --provider opt
    is specified it will be overridden. Otherwise the default provider
    is used.

Author: Swapnil Kulkarni <me@coolsvap.net>

* Update tox.ini to execute the pep8 tests
    Currently if i do tox -e pep8
    - it does not run
    - fails to create the test env
    Updated following,
    - tox.ini to include testenv
    Added test-requirements for flake8


## Atomic App 0.1.3 (2015-Aug-17)

This is a hotfix to 0.1.2 and removed a bug we had in [all LABELs of the Dockerfiles](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/issues/217).


## Atomic App 0.1.2

With this release we have fixed many bugs and implemented many enhancements. To follow
the development in details, please have a look at the [Atomic App Issue tracker](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/issues/).

This release contains the changes support the deployment of Atomic Apps via [Cockpit web UI](http://cockpit-project.org/).

Starting with 0.1.2 a new LABEL has been added to the docker container image: `io.projectatomic.nulecule.atomicappversion` so that
an external entity can figure out what version of atomicapp is provided by that container image.

A short overview of the major new features is given below.

Author: Subin M <subin@apache.org>

 * add LABEL for atomicapp version to Atomic App Base Container Image

Author: Václav Pavlín <vaclav.pavlin@gmail.com>

 * Create a lock file and fail if it's already locked to prevent concurrent Atomic Apps running

 * Merge pull request #206 from goern/feature/travis-pep8
   [trivial] Feature/travis pep8

 * Merge pull request #169 from sub-mod/cockpit-integration, see https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/2474

 * Add dry-run checks to install

Author: Daniel Veillard <veillard@redhat.com>

 *  Fix a logic bug -  if the id is not found the exception won't be raised by the expected
    code for it but ny the access to the dict in the message before it

Author: Aaron Weitekamp <aweiteka@redhat.com>

 *  Update openshift provider command

 *  OpenShift is now using 'oc', formerly 'osc'.
    This updates the CLI string and also adds support
    for non-root usage. When non-root the oc symlink
    is broken inside the container. In this case we
    create a symlink inside the container.

Author: Christoph Görn <goern@redhat.com>

 * replaces GNU AGPL by GNU LGPL

 *  initial version of python unittest and coveralls based testing
    I removed shell based tests, as they are replaced by python based tests.

 *  using pytest and coverage, converted to a TestSuite
    added an sys.exit() to cli.main.run(), as a CLI should return something.

Author: Ian McLeod <imcleod@redhat.com>

 *  Initial drop of tests for Travis CI

    These two tests take advantage of the --dry-run option as well as the caching of
    previously extracted Docker image content.  If any element of this caching
    behavior is changed, these test will likely need to be recreated.

    The two tests Nulecules are borrowed from the nulecule spec examples here:

    https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/tree/master/examples

    I created this test content by doing a dry run on a system actually running
    Docker, then extracting the "external" directory.
